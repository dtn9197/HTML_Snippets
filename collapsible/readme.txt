Collapsible
	• A collapsible works by hiding the collapsible section
	• A css selector is written for the section that you want to hide/show
		○ This rule involves using the display property and set it to none and back to block or something else
	• A click event listener is added to a tab to toggle the css selector that hides the content on/off
